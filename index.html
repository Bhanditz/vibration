        This document represents the consensus of the group on the scope and
        features of the Vibration API. It should be noted that the group is
        aware of more advanced use cases that cannot be realized using this
        simpler first version. The intent is to address them in a future
        revision.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API is specifically designed to address use cases that require
        simple tactile feedback only. Use cases requiring more fine-grained
        control are out of scope for this specification. This API is not meant
        to be used as a generic notification mechanism. Such use cases may be
        handled using the <cite>Notifications API</cite> [[NOTIFICATIONS]]
        specification. In addition, determining whether vibration is enabled is
        out of scope for this specification.

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="ua">user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL-1]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.

        The <code id=

        vibrate()</code> method, when invoked, MUST run the algorithm for
        <a>processing vibration patterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules for <dfn>processing vibration patterns</dfn> are as given in
        the following algorithm:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>pattern</var> be the first method argument of the
        <code>vibrate()</code> method.
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>valid pattern</var> be the result of passing
        <var>pattern</var> to <a>validate and normalize</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If the <code><a href=
        "http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/PageVisibility/Overview.html#dom-document-hidden">
          hidden</a></code> attribute [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]] is set to true, then
          return false and terminate these steps.
          <div class="note">
            A trusted (also known as privileged) application that integrates
            closely with the operating system's functionality may vibrate the
            device even if such an application is not visible at all, and thus
            may ignore the previous step.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Perform vibration</a> with <var>valid pattern</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To <dfn>validate and normalize</dfn> a vibration pattern given
        <var>pattern</var>, run these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If <var>pattern</var> is a list, proceed to the next step.
        Otherwise run the following substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>list</var> be an initially empty list, and add
            <var>pattern</var> to <var>list</var>.
            </li>
            <li>Set <var>pattern</var> to <var>list</var>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>max length</var> be an implementation-dependent maximum
        length of <var>pattern</var>.
          <div class='note'>
            If the length of a pattern is greater than max length an
            implementation of this API could consider breaking the request
            effectively into multiple shorter requests internally to achieve
            the same effect, rather than ignoring what follows the max length.
            There are cases, however, where it is appropriate to ignore the
            pattern exceeding the max length. An example is if the length is so
            long that it would effectively create a denial of service attack on
            the user. A web application might also make multiple requests if it
            is known to the application that the length is too long for some
            implementations and a possible gap in between patterns is
            acceptable.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>If the length of <var>pattern</var> is greater than <var>max
        length</var>, truncate <var>pattern</var>, leaving only the first <var>
          max length</var> entries.

            If the length of the <var>pattern</var> is even and not zero then
            the last entry in the pattern will have no effect so an
            implementation can remove it from the <var>pattern</var> at this
            point.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>max duration</var> be an implementation-dependent maximum
        duration for a single vibration entry in a <var>pattern</var>.
        </li>
        <li>For each entry in <var>pattern</var> whose value is greater than
        <var>max duration</var>, set the entry's value to <var>max
        duration</var>.
        </li>
        <li>Return <var>pattern</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To <dfn>perform vibration</dfn> using <var>pattern</var>, run these
        steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An implementation MAY return false and terminate these steps.
          <div class="note">
            For example, an implementation might abort the algorithm because
            the user has set a preference indicating that pages at a given
            origin should never be able to vibrate the device, or an
            implementation might cap the total amount of time a page may cause
            the device to vibrate and reject requests in excess of this limit.
          </div>

        <li>If another instance of the <a>perform vibration</a> algorithm is

            <li>Abort that other instance of the <a>perform vibration</a>
            algorithm, if any.
            </li>
            <li>If <var>pattern</var> is an empty list, contains a single entry
            with a value of 0, or if the device is unable to vibrate, then
            return true and terminate these steps.
            </li>

        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the following example the device will vibrate for 1000 milliseconds
        (ms):
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
        // vibrate for 1000 ms
        navigator.vibrate(1000);
        
        // or alternatively
        navigator.vibrate([1000]);
      </pre>
      <p>
        In the following example the pattern will cause the device to vibrate
        for 50 ms, be still for 100 ms, and then vibrate for 150 ms:
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
        navigator.vibrate([50, 100, 150]);
      </pre>
      <p>
        The following example cancels any existing vibrations:
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
          // cancel any existing vibrations
          navigator.vibrate(0);
          
          // or alternatively
          navigator.vibrate([]);
